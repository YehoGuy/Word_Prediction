## Some Runtime Stats:

# Without local aggregation (8 Mappers):
▪ Number of Map Output Records was: 56,963,480.
▪ Number of Reduce Input Records: 56,963,480.
▪ Time Elapsed: 26 minutes, 33 seconds.

# With local aggregation - Combiner1 (8 Mappers):
▪ Number of Map Output Records was: 56,963,480.
▪ Number of Reduce Input Records: 812,839.
▪ Time Elapsed: 24 min 29 sec.
* We can see that local aggregation saved a ton of data communication between the Hadoop nodes,
* Yet the time did not improve drastically - __Amdahl's Law__ - local aggregation was needed and used only at step 1.
